Working on the HMRC account to migrate a legacy VAT checking tool to a modern architecture. Using Microsoft TestEngine for automation testing of the Microsoft PowerApp. Also, using JMeter for performance testing.

In my previous assignment, I was implementing BDD testing with Java and Cucumber. This enabled me to apply my previous knowledge in BDD testing to transform how testing is conducted within the team.
