Carrying out automation testing alongside manual testing of projects. This has allowed improvement to my current skills in C# and SpecFlow. Additionally, an opportunity to learn new skills such as automating APIs, LINQ, ElasticSearch and writing cleaner code. Also, developing the ability to balance two types of testing at the same time has been an enjoyable challenge.

Furthermore, being a source of guidance to my team members in automation testing activities such as defining tests, code reviews and coming up with good code design solutions.

Also, taking part in project analysis meetings to clarify requirements or raise any concerns before they go into the development phase.
