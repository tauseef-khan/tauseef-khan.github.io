Being a QA Lead in releases, increasing the automation feature coverage and using a varied number of tools and techniques to test items of work are my daily tasks at eviivo.

As well communicating with product owners, developers and team leads in order to deploy releases on time and with high quality to increase eviivoâ€˜s market share and customer base. The technologies I used for automation testing were C#, Selenium and SpecFlow.
